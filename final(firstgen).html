			<p style="font-size:20px;">Krissy McGee’s family never stays in one place for too long. Growing up, she moved over 11 times, most recently landing in Aurora, Illinois– just an hour’s drive from Northwestern University, where she’s spent her last four years studying, working and building community as one of Northwestern’s first-generation students.</p>

			<p style="font-size:20px;">Last month, McGee won the first “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/krissymcgee_i-just-need-to-brag-about-our-team-for-a-activity-7128813845149614080-WVuH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="new">I’m First: Trailblazer Award</a>,” which honors an ambitious first-generation student for demonstrating academic excellence and commitment to community. The <em>I’m First</em> committee received over 50 nominations– many of which named McGee.</p>
		
			<p style="font-size:20px;">“I never thought I would be recognized for just trying to make it through the day,” says McGee, reflecting on the <em>I’m First</em> celebration. “I never felt like I was going above and beyond. I felt like I was doing what I had to do.”</p>
		
			<p style="font-size:20px;">The award was part of Northwestern’s first <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/enrichment/communities/im-first/" target="new">week-long</a> program to celebrate first-generation students. Assistant Director of Student Enrichment Services Mayra Garces took part in the organization of <em>I’m First</em> week.</p>

			<p style="font-size:20px;">“We really wanted a place for students to come and be in community,” she says. SES offers several programs for incoming FGLI students, including cohort-based programs like <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/enrichment/programs/compass/">Compass</a>– a year-long peer mentorship program– and <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/enrichment/programs/knight-community-scholars.html">Knight Community Scholars</a>, which provides individual and group advising, community-building opportunities, and workshops.</p>

			
			<p style="font-size:20px;">As an incoming freshman, McGee was hand-selected by SES to join Northwestern’s Knight Community Scholars. McGee, surrounded by other FGLI students, began to embrace the label.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:20px;">“This is a group of people with a unique subset of skills and experiences,” she says. “And we deserve to recognize that.”</p>

			<p style="font-size:20px;">Although programs like Compass and Knight Community Scholars provide mentorship to FGLI students, not all eligible students take part. Knight Community Scholars selects 30-40 students each year and Compass selects 30, says Garces. </p>
		
			<p style="font-size:20px;">“We’re still not touching all first-gen students in those programs,” she says. This year, Northwestern admitted over 300 first-generation undergraduate students, which leaves quite a few students unaccounted for. </p>
			
			<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/15977462"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
			
		
			<p style="font-size:20px;">While <em>I’m First</em> week was a promising start, SES wants future programs “to reflect the unique experiences and challenges of FGLI students,” says Garces. SES also plans to boost “relationship building between faculty and students” and improve– or construct– support networks for all first-generation students at Northwestern.</p>
		
			<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/15977247"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
		
			<p style="font-size:20px;">Some first-generation students have support networks outside of the university. Although third-year Fadi Youhana navigated the college admissions process alone, he was able to guide his younger sister through her college applications– now, she is a second-year at Notre Dame. Youhana credits his mother for all his achievements.</p>
		
			<p style="font-size:20px;">“My mom did everything she could’ve done,” he says. </p>
		
			<p style="font-size:20px;"> Youhana’s mother valued higher education. She encouraged him and his younger sister to do well academically and apply to competitive universities. </p>
			
			<p style="font-size:20px;">“My mom, I call her at least every other day” he says, “She's the biggest reason I’m here.”</p>
